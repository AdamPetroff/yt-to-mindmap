# YT to Mind Map

## Current Limitations

- OpenAI Context limit. I am limited to 8k token limit, so I can't provide the whole transcript on longer videos.
- GPT-4 refuses to provide deep structure.

## Notes

- In the mindmaps table, I'm putting an id column in, even though videoId could be enough of an identifier. I'm doing this because I want to be able to have multiple mindmaps for a video, and I want to be able to have multiple videos in a mindmap. I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but it's what I'm doing for now.
