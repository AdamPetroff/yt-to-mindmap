 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing ketamine ketamine is a fascinating compound and it's one that nowadays is being used both clinically for the treatment of depression and suicidality and PTSD and it is also a drug that is commonly abused that is ketamine is often used recreationally and it has a high potential for abuse so today we are going to discuss both the research on the clinical benefits of ketamine as well as the risks of ketamine we're going to discuss the mechanisms of action by which ketamine produces what are called dissociative States I will Define for you what a so-called k-hole is in scientific terms I will talk about dosages of ketamine I'll talk about delivery routes of ketamine and throughout I will be emphasizing both the clinical benefits and the risks that is the potential harms of using ketamine out of the appropriate clinical context so by the end of today's episode you will understand thoroughly what ketamine is how it works in the brain and body to produce dissociative States and to relieve depression and you will understand how it can actually change neural circuitry this is an important thing to understand about ketamine the acute or immediate effects of ketamine while one is under the influence of ketamine are just part of the story of how ketamine modifies the brain for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD and by extension when people use ketamine recreationally there are those immediate acute effects of ketamine but there are also long-term changes in the brain that are important to understand during today's discussion we will also be talking a lot about neuroplasticity or your nervous system's ability to change in response to experience and we will be talking about neuroplasticity not just in the context of ketamine but as a general theme for how your nervous system changes anytime you learn anything and in that discussion you're going to hear a lot about bdnf or brain derived nootrophic Factor brain derived nootrophic factor is a critical molecule for all forms of learning and memory and changes to your nervous system so in addition to learning about ketamine and how it works clinically and its relevance to recreational use and abuse you will also learn a lot about neuroplasticity and bdnf and what it's doing in your brain right now as you learn before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly when for instance you go from a shady area to a sunny area when you look at something up close or off in the distance Roca understands all of that and have designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that regardless of conditions you always see with perfect clarity their glasses are also extremely lightweight and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty in fact initially Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for use in sports things like running and cycling Etc and they still can be used for that but really their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed to be worn anytime I wear readers at night or when I drive at night and I'll sometimes wear sunglasses in the middle of the day although of course I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight exposure which everyone should be doing to set their

before on this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're sleeping well and enough all of those things are improved and when we are not sleeping well or enough all of those things mental health physical health and performance all get worse now a key component to getting a great night's sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment has to be such that your body temperature drops by one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and that your body temperature increase by about one to three degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed with eight sleep mattress covers you can customize the temperature of your sleeping environment such that you always get the best possible night's sleep I've been sleeping on a night sleep mattress cover for about two years now and I must say it has vastly improved my sleep if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to adesleep.com huberman and

many people have heard of ketamine but most people don't realize that ketamine is very similar to another drug called PCP or phen cycladine which goes by the street names angel dust or Sherm it has some other street names as well when I was growing up I heard a lot about PCP they taught us about it in school you'd hear about it on you know cop shows on television and the lore was that PCP would eliminate people's perception of pain and would make them violent you know you'd hear these stories in drug education classes that when people are on PCP they're punching light poles and breaking their hands you know they can fight off eight or ten police officers who are trying to handcuff them I don't know whether or not any of that is true or not but we heard a lot about PCP and it was associated with drugs of abuse things like cocaine methamphetamine it was lumped into that category nowadays when we hear about ketamine rarely do people mention that ketamine and PCP actually have the same mode of action more or less okay I'm not talking about the specifics I'm talking broadly they have the same mode of action in the brain that both of them are dissociative anesthetics and nowadays usually when we hear about ketamine we are hearing about its benefits we are hearing that it can help cure depression we are hearing that it can help reduce or cure suicide reality that it can be used to treat PTSD and indeed all of that is true in the appropriate clinical context at the appropriate dosages and given that the appropriate frequency ketamine has proven to be a miraculous drug for some people not all people for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD that said ketamine also has a very high potential for abuse and so it may come as no surprise that we often hear about ketamine nowadays also in the context of its use at parties you hear about people going into so-called k-holes which is a particular State associated with overdoing the dosage of ketamine a little or a lot we'll get back to that a little bit later what it is how dangerous it is ETC in any case ketamine is an incredible drug very similar to PCP phencyclidine and it is a drug that nowadays there is crossover between the clinical uses of ketamine for treatment of depression Etc and it's recreational use what do I mean by that what I'm referring to is people accessing ketamine legally for the purpose of treating depression but taking that ketamine out of the clinic out of the doctor's office which is a very different set of conditions than most of the studies that have been done on ketamine and its role in depression and not surprisingly if there is increased access to a drug like ketamine really any drug that has a potential for abuse then we also see an increase in the number of people that are using that drug recreationally and some of them do indeed get addicted to ketamine so I know many of you are probably wondering can you get addicted to ketamine indeed people can get addicted to ketamine there are some people who like its effects enough that they find themselves compelled to use ketamine even though the use of ketamine is degrading their overall life performance so work school relationships finances Etc that said ketamine does have these established clinical uses so nowadays the landscape around ketamine is oh so different than it was 10 or 20 years ago when it was lumped very closely with PCP phencyclidine and really just looked at as a drug of abuse there were some early cases in the 1970s of the use of ketamine in order to treat PTSD this was mainly in soldiers in Vietnam or people coming back from Vietnam but really the clinical use of ketamine for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD has really just taken off in the last five to ten years and that's what's brought us to this new landscape of interest and understanding and use of ketamine in the clinical and recreational context so how is it that a drug that at one time was really just viewed as a street drug that was bad bad bad is now being prescribed widely and has all this interest surrounding it and really this has to do with our understanding of what depression is and what depression isn't so I'd like to just take one or two minutes and explain to you a little bit about the history of depression and its treatment what we observe starting about the middle of the last century so around 1950 but really taking off in the early 1980s and 90s is the so-called monoamine hypothesis of depression monoamines as the name suggests are synthesized from amino acids that's a good way to remember monoamines monoamines include things like serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine although there are other monoamines as well monoamines are neurotransmitters or more specifically they are neuromodulators meaning they change the activity of neural circuits in the brain and body they can ramp up levels of activity in lots of different brain areas where they can reduce the activity of neural circuits in lots of different brain areas as well as within the body right your gut has serotonin and needs serotonin dopamine also plays important roles in the body etc etc the monoamine hypothesis of depression is really centered around the idea that it is deficiencies in these monoamines either serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine or some combination of those that gives rise to depression now in reality there is very little if any evidence that there is a deficiency of monoamines in any form of depression however it is very clear that drugs that increase certain monoamines so drugs like Prozac or Zoloft that increase serotonin or drugs like bupren which is often called Wellbutrin which is its commercial name which increases dopamine and norepinephrine can often provide relief for certain symptoms of depression in some people however what we've learned over the last 30 or 40 years is that drugs that are designed to increase certain monoamines in order to treat depression only work in about 40 percent of depressed people that take them and they have a lot of side effects now some people are lucky enough that they can use a low enough dose or perhaps even a high enough dose that gives them relief from their depressive symptoms but does not give them side effects that make it so uncomfortable for them to use that drug that they would choose rather to not take that drug however a lot of people that do get depression relief from things like Zoloft or Paxil or from buprone find that the side effects which include things like dry mouth although more commonly reductions or increases in appetite or vast reductions in libido or changes in their sleep patterns Etc that those side effects really make it impossible or at least very uncomfortable for them to take those drugs and of course there are the 60 percent of depressed people who do not respond to those drugs at all now I want to be very clear things like ssris things like Wellbutrin have helped a tremendous number of people get relief from depressive symptoms and in many cases have warded off suicidality as well however there are also a great number of people who have experienced a lot of side effects and problems from these drugs hence the desire to find other compounds that can treat depression without creating similar side effect profiles and that ideally can provide relief not just for 40 percent but for all people suffering from depression so that's where ketamine enters the picture prior to the 1990s they were mainly studied in neuroscience and pharmacology Laboratories for their abuse properties and for their anesthetic properties so ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic it's actually used to induce certain forms of anesthesia for surgery it's not always used but it's often used this is something that if you've ever had a surgery you might want to ask your anesthesiologist about you know what sorts of drugs are you giving me to go under what sorts of drugs are you keeping me to stay under and maybe even what sorts of drugs are you giving me to bring me out of anesthesia because it turns out that when you go into anesthesia your anesthesiologist is rarely giving you just one drug typically they're giving you one drug to you know kill off a little bit of anxiety and maybe eliminate a little bit of pain sometimes and then they'll give you another drug to drop you into a deeper plane of anesthesia and then nowadays there are sophisticated ways to monitor your plane of anesthesia and their sophisticated ways to if necessary get you out of a deep plane of anesthesia if that plane of anesthesia is too deep when I talk about a plane of anesthesia I'm just talking about going from Full wakefulness to you know a reduction in anxiety to falling asleep to a sleep to the point where even if someone were to pinch your toe or your arm like a really intense pinch that you wouldn't wake up from that okay so ketamine has the property of being an anesthetic it kills the response to pain and at certain doses it can bring you into deep planes of anesthesia at lesser dosages it can take you into transition points between awake and deeply anesthetized and it's really that transition point between awake and deeply anesthetize which we are going to call the dissociative State it's kind of this liminal State a little bit like dreaming it can have some dreamlike qualities to it that's the state that has most often been sought after or employed for the treatment of depression suicidality and PTSD which brings up a really important point which is that when people use ketamine recreationally it's not clear exactly what plane of anesthesia or dissociation they are actually seeking and this is why we hear about some of the desired effects of ketamine that are driving people to use it recreationally and while we also hear about people having some unpleasant or even very unpleasant or dangerous experiences when using ketamine recreationally because we're talking about a drug that has a lot of different effects depending on the dosages and as we'll soon talk about individuals vary tremendously in their response to different dosages of ketamine and the delivery route for ketamine whether or not it's delivered orally in the form of a pill or put sublingually in what's called atroche that dissolves under the tongue or it's injected and then it's injected into the vein or intramuscularly Etc each of those can produce very different effects in terms of this speed of onset of the drug and the type of effects that it produces in the brain and body so what happened in the early 90s is that Laboratories that were studying animal models what we call pre-clinical models of things like depression and learning and memory and to some extent ketamine but mainly focusing on learning and memory and depression made an interesting Discovery there's a certain pre-clinical model of depression that's pretty common in Laboratories that involves taking a rat or a mouse and putting it into a small container like it looks like a beaker or a jar sometimes it's a tray and it has water in it and you might be surprised to learn perhaps not that if you put a rat or a mouse into water it will swim okay so it's treading water in order to keep its head above water and not drown I realize for some of you this might be a bit of an aversive topic to hear about animal research but this is one of the common preclinical models of depression which is put a rat or a mouse into water let it swim and see at what point it gives up because what happens is if you put a rat or Mouse into water it will attempt to save its own life by swimming but at some point it will just give up and it will just start sinking and then of course the researcher needs to rescue the router Mouse put it back into its home cage dry it off give it some food Etc this preclinical model is called the model of learn helplessness and it's become a prominent pre-clinical model of depression because of course we can't ask mice or rats if they are depressed or happy I suppose you can ask them but they're not going to answer in any kind of meaningful way so we can only look at their behavior in order to understand whether or not they have a sense of happiness or a sense of depression and of course that's very hard to gauge in an animal model of any kind you could make guesses based on other behaviors like are they grooming regularly are they eating regularly you know things that more or less parallel what we think of as health or lack of Health in a human who's happy or depressed but in the context of trying to understand depression in these pre-clinical animal models having a behavior that you can really quantify carefully across a lot of different animals and conditions is really beneficial so this thing of putting a rat or Mouse into water and seeing how long it takes before they give up to save their own life is called the model of learned helplessness and what it allowed researchers to do was to take routes and mice put them into water see how long it took before they gave up and then to give them different drugs to see whether or not any of those drugs either hastened sped up or prolonged the duration over which the animal would attempt to save its own life this actually has some meaningful parallels to human depression you know one of the Hallmarks of depression is that people stop thinking positively about their future depression of course can include a lot of other symptoms you know one of the most prominent symptoms of depression for instance is consistently waking up around 2 30 or 3 30 in the morning and not being able to fall back asleep again now keep in mind it is not the case that if you're waking up at 2 30 or 3 30 in the morning and you can't fall back asleep that you are absolutely depressed that's simply not the case but that pattern of lack of sleep plus some other things like lack of anticipation of a positive future inability to imagine the future in any kind of meaningful or positive way Etc are part of the key features of what we call a major depressive episode so this pre-clinical model of learned helplessness allowed researchers to test a lot of different drugs and establish which drugs at which dosages allowed animals to fight for their life longer when placed into water it's really that simple as a model but it revealed some very interesting things at least one of which is that when animals were injected with ketamine this dissociative anesthetic but they were injected with dosages of ketamine that were below what would induce full anesthesia these animals would swim for their life for a lot longer now to some extent that ought to be surprising and in fact was surprising to researchers because ketamine is what's called an nmda receptor blocker now when I say blocker I'm not getting into the details of what specific form of blocker it is but I do want to mention that a blocker is sometimes referred to as an antagonist whereas something that promotes the activity of a receptor is called an Agonist okay so if you can just remember that ketamine is an nmda receptor antagonist or blocker then you should be fine for the rest of today's conversation now I haven't told you what nmda is nmda stands for n-methyl-d aspartate and you do not need to remember that but the surprise for researchers was that this drug ketamine is allowing animals to fight for their life for longer so it has this sort of property of overcoming what we call learned helplessness or a sense of helplessness AKA antidepressant effects and we also know that it's an nmda receptor antagonist or blocker and that's perplexing because we also know that the nmda receptor is critical for changing neural circuitry in the brain it's critical for neuroplasticity so put differently here's a drug that blocks the receptor that's critical for neuroplasticity for changes in the brain and yet somehow it's allowing these animals to fight for their life longer it's somehow giving them more of a sense of hope at least that's the subjective interpretation of what one observes when a mouse or rat is swimming for much longer when it would otherwise just give up and sink to the bottom of the vessel now in general there are two kinds of scientists there are scientists that take a look at a set of findings like that and say oh here's a drug that's supposed to be terrible for us it's an anesthetic and it blocks nmda receptors and nmda receptors are good for neuroplasticity and somehow it's also allowing these animals to swim longer and I would say one category of scientists would just look at that and just say wow that is a big ball or tangle of confused facts like how does one even reconcile that right brain change ought to be good and perhaps even lie at the heart of our ability to recover from depression this is drug that blocks neuroplasticity but somehow is relieving depression I'm going to walk away from that I'm going to work on something far simpler and then there's this other category of scientists which thank goodness exists who looks at that apparent contradiction of okay there's a drug which blocks plasticity plasticity is thought to be important for getting over depression and yet the drug can provide some relief from depression at least in these preclinical animal models and they say hmm I like a good puzzle right the more complex the puzzle the more interesting and they start digging in with pre-clinical studies and they start talking to clinicians who are treating patients for depression and like I said thank goodness these sorts of scientists exist and thank goodness they did that because it turned out that when clinicians tried ketamine in depressed patients as a means to relieve depression it had remarkable effects so it was about the year 2000 when the first sets of papers about the clinical use of ketamine for the treatment of Depression started to emerge now we have to remember the context in which all of this was happening you know in 2000 drugs like Prozac and some of similar ssris selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors things like Wellbutrin were really hitting the market in full force and as we talked about earlier some people were getting relief some people were getting relief with a lot of side effects and therefore deciding not to take those drugs and a lot of people the majority of people that were taking those drugs were not getting relief so there was a real urgent need to find other drugs for the treatment of depression and ketamine at least based on its apparent profile of being a dissociative anesthetic would seem like the last drug that you'd want to use to treat depression right it dissociates people even hear about dissociation as a symptom of depression and yet what happened was a small number very pioneering clinicians started to explore the use of ketamine in the clinic for the treatment of depression and in particular for depression that did not respond to any other treatment so there was a real critical need to find other compounds and a bit more motivation to test some of these let's call them atypical compounds for the treatment of depression so one of the first Landmark papers in the use of ketamine for the treatment of depression is entitled antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients this is a paper that I've provided a link to in the show note captions it's a small study okay so it doesn't involve many subjects at all it really just has seven subjects all of whom had major depression and they did intravenous injections with half a milligram per kilogram of body weight of ketamine now that dosage half a milligram per kilogram of body weight turns out to be very important for today's discussion because it's going to serve as a reference point for later discussions when we get into other modes of delivery of ketamine such as oral pill form ketamine or sublingual ketamine and as it relates to things like the k-hole or the dissociative State or the various effects that ketamine can have depending on the dosage and the delivery route meanwhile going back to this study what they found is that when they injected patients with severe depression with ketamine the effects of ketamine took place within minutes within 10 or 15 minutes and that they experienced a sort of peak euphoric State okay so they're not inducing deep anesthesia right at this dosage they're getting people into a kind of euphoric dreamy semi-dissociative state that occurred within 15 minutes and really peaked about 45 minutes to an hour after they were injected with the drug and that the total effects of the drug in terms of euphoria were effectively over by about two hours or so and that time course of effects makes perfect sense if you look at say the half-life of ketamine which is how long it takes for half of the drug to be active in the system Etc but what was really interesting about this study and others like it is that the patients experienced relief from their depression almost immediately after taking the drug So within minutes to hours and that it persisted for several days after taking the ketamine okay so the dissociative euphoric dreamlike effects of ketamine take place very quickly they're very very Salient right the person basically is just lying there experiencing this euphoric dreamliked associative state and they get some relief from their depression immediately and yet there's persistent relief from that depression which lasted at least three days out from the treatment now a key theme of today's discussion is going to be that the antidepressant effects of ketamine appear to be fairly short-lived at least when one is exploring one or two treatments with ketamine in other words the typical Contour is that people will take ketamine get this euphoric dreamlike dissociative effect come out of that feeling some immediate relief from their depression this is one of the things that makes ketamine an incredibly attractive drug for the treatment of depression especially depression that hasn't responded to other forms of treatment which is that people get relief very very quickly indeed the same day that they initiate the treatment now this is especially important when you think about the fact that the monoamine hypothesis of depression which drove the discovery and development of all these drugs like ssris Wellbutrin etc those drugs often can provide support for people with depression again only 40 of people get true relief from their depression and again there are some side effect issues or major side effect issues in some cases that have to be dealt with but even the positive effects even under the best conditions oftentimes those effects don't kick in for weeks or months after somebody initiates taking the drug now that might not seem like a long time to wait for some of you but if you are somebody suffering from depression even another day even another hour with depression seems almost unmanageable and sadly many people who have these forms of depression will go on to commit suicide so it is ever so important that there be rapid treatments for depression even same day treatments for depression and based on the study it appeared that ketamine was and indeed Still Remains that drug now I certainly don't want to position ketamine in your mind as a miracle drug for depression in fact I don't actually believe in Miracle drugs I don't think that there is any compound that alone can produce all the desired effects that one wants without any negative effects in a way that could warrant calling it a miracle drug that's just not how biology works there's always an interplay between pharmacology between our behaviors and what we choose to do or not do this is a topic we'll get into a little bit later when we talk about anti-depressive behaviors and the role of ketamine in bringing about anti-depressive behaviors for the relief of depression now with that said the study that I just mentioned as well as many many other studies that followed emphasize that ketamine could provide significant decreases in not just depression and suicidality but also the feelings of helplessness and worthlessness that are associated with major depression and again it could do that in people that also were not responding to other forms of depression treatment such as ssris Etc so while we don't want to call it a miracle drug ketamine turned out to be and remains an incredible drug for the treatment of depression in certain cases now in addition to that ketamine has been shown in clinical studies to provide relief not just for treatment resistant depression of the major depression type right there's many different forms of depression but major depression is the one that we're normally thinking about or referring to when we talk about depression but ketamine has also been shown to be effective in treating bipolar depression sometimes called bipolar disorder although more commonly nowadays called bipolar depression I did an entire episode by the way on bipolar depression if you want to know what it is and what it isn't how it differs from borderline personality disorder Etc you can go to hubermanlab.com just put into the search function bipolar and it will take you to that episode ketamine has also been shown to be useful for the treatment of PTSD and for OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder and for anxiety and for various forms of substance addiction so ketamine is not a miracle drug but it does seem to have broad application and to be very successful for the treatment of a lot of major psychiatric challenges now just because ketamine has shown these incredible applications it also has some serious problems that are directly related to how it works in the brain or at least from what we understand of how it works in the brain what I'm referring to here is yes ketamine is very rapid acting it can often provide relief from depression almost immediately meaning same day however it is very short-lived after about three days or a week or so the antidepressant effects of ketamine often wear off so that creates a situation where people perhaps need to take ketamine every week and yet it creates enough of a dissociative State meaning it takes people enough out of their normal daily routine that the prospect of people taking ketamine every week is actually not that feasible and also because of some of the propensity for ketamine to become a drug of abuse that is for it to be habit-forming and or addicting one also worries that if people are doing ketamine every week to treat their depression that they can become so-called hooked on ketamine now fortunately there have been studies of ketamine and how it works not just in the short term but in the longer term that have led to some very important clinical studies that have explored for instance people taking ketamine twice per week for a duration of three weeks total and what they find is that yes after the first time they take it they get some relief from depression they take it a second time that week they get some relief from depression and they do the same thing the next week and the next week and when they do that they get relief from depression the whole way through that entire three weeks but it turns out that there's also some so-called durability to the effect such that if people do this twice a week dosing regimen so ketamine twice a week for three weeks total they find that when they end that three weeks they get some ongoing relief from their depressive symptoms which can extend months or more before they have to repeat that twice a week for three weeks regimen now certainly not all studies of using ketamine for the treatment of depression have used that exact dosage regimen twice a week for three weeks then take some time off repeat twice a week for three weeks take some time off repeat some have explored giving ketamine once per week or even three times per week or doing it once a week for five weeks and then taking an extended period of time off before repeating the treatment schedule there are a bunch of different studies out there but when one looks at all of those studies and mass together it's very clear that ketamine is providing relief from depressive symptoms immediately and in the days after the treatment but that when those treatments are act fairly closely together that there is some durability some ongoing relief from depression and what this tells us is very important in fact I hope everybody really highlight this in their minds as they're hearing it it's very likely that ketamine is acting by at least two and probably three different mechanisms in order to provide relief from depression one of those mechanisms induces relief from depression very quickly and seems to be associated with that euphoric dissociative dreamlike state that one experiences when they are under the influence of ketamine the second mechanism seems to provide relief from depression in the days and weeks that follow the ketamine treatment and there also appears to be a third mechanism by which ketamine can induce long lasting changes in the nervous system and it is those three mechanisms short medium and long-term mechanisms that produce the kinds of changes in neurochemistry and more importantly changes in actual neural circuit wiring that allows ketamine to provide this incredible relief from depression so next we're going to turn to what those mechanisms are because in understanding those mechanisms you will understand how ketamine provides this relief from depression but you'll also come to understand the more important broader theme of what depression is really all about at a neural circuit level and how relief from depression is all about neuroplasticity
